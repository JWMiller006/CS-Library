# CS-Library

This is a library which I have written over the years to make certain actions easier. simply put, not everything here is completely useful since I have gotten more experienced over time. 

# NUGET Download
Download with NUGET package MillerInc.CSLibrary in Package Manager

# NOTICE
I have recieved reports of errors with including this library in their projects. 
1. Try calling the namespace CMDLibrary, the orignal library name
2. Go to the Github project and download the project dll (/bin/release/CMDLibrary.dll) and all of the other files in the folder and include them in your project
3. Email me @jwmiller006@outlook.com with any errors that you experience

Thank you for your patience while I figure out a better solution

# CS-Library

This is a library which I have written over the years to make certain actions easier. simply put, not everything here is completely useful since I have gotten more experienced over time. 

# NUGET Download
Download with NUGET package MillerInc in Package Manager (was MillerInc.CSLibrary)

# NOTICE
I have recieved reports of errors with including this library in their projects with the associated Nuget Package; this error is no longer present in the .NetStandard 2.0 library: MillerInc which has similar functions (see https://github.com/JWMiller006/MillerInc)
1. Try calling the namespace CMDLibrary, the orignal library name
2. Go to the Github project and download the project dll (/bin/release/CMDLibrary.dll) and all of the other files in the folder and include them in your project
3. Email me @jwmiller006@outlook.com with any errors that you experience

Thank you for your flexibility
